{{< typewriter data="About Me">}}

I'm a senior at Yale majoring in history. I'm a first-generation college
student from Louisville, Kentucky, and I'm passionate about
the intersection of humanities, law, and technology. I love working on [projects](/experience)
that make the world a better place.

CHANGE THIS TO: Experience Some things (and people) I love:

* <b>My mom</b>, papa, brother Vlad, and sister-in-law Megan
* My two nieces, Naomi and Remi :)
* Cappuccinos, espressos, cold brews--*Anything* coffee
* Exploring new coffee shops + restaurants in New Haven, Chicago, and Louisville

Some things I'm passionate about:

* How can we make the reality of the American Dream a possibility for everyone?
* How can we leverage artificial intelligence to build a more just legal system?
* How can we leverage the law and public policy to incentivize innovation?
* How can we use technology to create more opportunities?
* How can we use and teach history to bring us closer together?
